# Statistics & Machine Learning Resources

This is a list of books and courses on statistics and machine learning.
The first list will be restricted to those which I personally recommmend,
and those which are frequently recommended by others.

## 1. Statistics

### 1.1 Recommendations

**Books**

1. Introduction to Statistical Learning - with applications in R, by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani: [http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)
2. The Elements of Statistical Learning, by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman: [https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
3. Think Bayes - Bayesian Statistics Made Simple, by Allen B. Downey [https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/)

**Course**

3. Statistics: The Complete Mini-Course, by Cassie Kozyrkov: [https://decision.substack.com/p/statistics-the-complete-mini-course](https://decision.substack.com/p/statistics-the-complete-mini-course)

**Visualization**

4. Seeing Theory, by Daniel Kunin et al: [https://seeing-theory.brown.edu](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu) (note that this is also a book)

I have seen many recommendations for the books *Introduction to Statistical Learning - with applications in R* (ISLR)
and *The Elements of Statistical Learning* (ESL). The *Statistics: The Complete Mini-Course* is included because
it gives a good introduction without the technical jargon, and has a strong focus on concepts and applications.
Lastly, *Seeing Theory* has an excellent series of visualisations for explaining concepts in statistics.

### 1.2 Under Review

These are other books that I have come across, and will be reviewing them to see if they should be placed in the recommended list. 

1. Think Stats - Exploratory Data Analysis in Python, by Allen B. Downey: [https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/). [PDF](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf). This book has a first edition: [Think Stats - Probability and Statistics for Programmers](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/index.html).
